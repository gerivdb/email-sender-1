# Cache Eviction Logic Verification

## Summary of Changes Made

### Problem Identified

The cache eviction test was failing because of race conditions in the `cacheResult` and `evictOldest` methods where `cacheSize` was being accessed under different locks (`cacheLock` vs `statsLock`).

### Fixes Applied

1. **Eliminated Deadlock Potential**: Removed the separate `evictOldest()` method that was causing lock ordering issues.

2. **Inline Eviction Logic**: Moved eviction logic directly into `cacheResult()` and `SetMaxCacheSize()` methods to ensure proper lock ordering.

3. **Thread-Safe Size Management**: 
   - `cacheSize` is always accessed under `statsLock` for reads
   - `cacheSize` updates are done under `statsLock` for writes
   - Cache map operations are done under `cacheLock`

4. **Removed Redundant Checks**: Eliminated the duplicate `len(p.evictQueue) == 0` check inside the eviction loop.

## Expected Behavior

### Test Configuration

- Cache max size: 12,288 bytes (exactly 2 embeddings)
- Each embedding: 1536 dimensions × 4 bytes = 6,144 bytes
- Cache hit rate: 100% (deterministic for testing)

### Test Sequence: ["first", "second", "third"]

#### Step 1: Insert "first"

- Cache: {"first": embedding}
- Size: 6,144 bytes
- Queue: ["first"]
- Result: ✓ Successfully cached

#### Step 2: Insert "second"  

- Cache: {"first": embedding, "second": embedding}
- Size: 12,288 bytes (at limit)
- Queue: ["first", "second"]
- Result: ✓ Successfully cached

#### Step 3: Insert "third"

- Current size (12,288) + new size (6,144) = 18,432 bytes > 12,288 limit
- **Eviction triggered**: Remove "first" (oldest in FIFO queue)
- Cache: {"second": embedding, "third": embedding}
- Size: 12,288 bytes
- Queue: ["second", "third"]
- Result: ✓ Successfully cached, "first" evicted

### Final Expected State

- ✗ "first" should NOT be in cache (evicted)
- ✓ "second" should be in cache
- ✓ "third" should be in cache

## Code Changes Summary

### Before (Race Condition)

```go
func (p *MockEmbeddingProvider) cacheResult(text string, embedding []float32) {
    p.cacheLock.Lock()
    defer p.cacheLock.Unlock()
    // ... size calculation ...
    if needEviction {
        p.evictOldest() // Called while holding cacheLock
    }
    // ... cache update ...
}

func (p *MockEmbeddingProvider) evictOldest() {
    // No locks - accessing cacheSize directly (RACE CONDITION!)
    // or accessing cacheSize under different lock than cache map
}
```plaintext
### After (Thread-Safe)

```go
func (p *MockEmbeddingProvider) cacheResult(text string, embedding []float32) {
    p.cacheLock.Lock()
    defer p.cacheLock.Unlock()
    // ... size calculation ...
    
    if p.maxCacheSize > 0 {
        for len(p.evictQueue) > 0 {
            // Safe size check under statsLock
            p.statsLock.RLock()
            currentSize := p.cacheSize
            p.statsLock.RUnlock()
            
            if currentSize+newSize <= p.maxCacheSize {
                break
            }
            
            // Direct eviction under cacheLock
            oldest := p.evictQueue[0]
            p.evictQueue = p.evictQueue[1:]
            
            if oldEmbed, exists := p.cache[oldest]; exists {
                delete(p.cache, oldest)
                // Safe size update under statsLock
                p.statsLock.Lock()
                p.cacheSize -= int64(len(oldEmbed) * 4)
                p.statsLock.Unlock()
            }
        }
    }
    // ... cache update ...
}

## Race Condition Resolution

### The Problem

- `cache` map was protected by `cacheLock`
- `cacheSize` was protected by `statsLock`  
- `evictOldest()` was called while holding `cacheLock` but needed to access `cacheSize`
- This created potential deadlocks and race conditions

### The Solution

- All cache operations (map + queue) now happen under `cacheLock`
- Size reads use temporary `statsLock` acquisition with immediate release
- Size updates use proper `statsLock` acquisition
- No method calls between different lock acquisitions
- FIFO queue operations are atomic within the lock scope

## Testing Status

Due to antivirus software blocking test execution, the logic has been verified through:
1. ✅ Code compilation success
2. ✅ Static analysis showing no errors
3. ✅ Manual code review confirming race condition elimination
4. ✅ Logic verification against expected FIFO behavior

The cache eviction test should now pass with the corrected implementation.
