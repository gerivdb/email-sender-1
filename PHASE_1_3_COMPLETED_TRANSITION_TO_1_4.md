## 🎯 NEXT PHASE: 1.4 CONFIGURATION MANAGEMENT AUDIT

### Phase 1.4 Objectives

**Primary Goal:** Evaluate the current configuration system and its alignment with ConfigManager (v43a)

### Scope of Analysis

**📋 Configuration Structure Analysis:**
- **Target Files**: `dependency-manager.config.json`, `manifest.json`
- **Analysis Areas**: Structure, clarity, completeness of configuration
- **Integration Focus**: ConfigManager alignment and centralized configuration management

**🔄 Configuration Loading & Usage Analysis:**
- **Code Analysis**: How configuration is loaded and utilized in the codebase
- **Pattern Assessment**: Configuration access patterns throughout the application
- **Validation Review**: Configuration validation and error handling

**🏗️ ConfigManager Integration Planning:**
- **Centralized Management**: Integration with ConfigManager for unified configuration
- **Dynamic Configuration**: Support for runtime configuration changes
- **Parameter Identification**: Which configuration parameters should be managed centrally

### Expected Deliverables

**📄 Phase 1.4 Deliverables:**
1. **Configuration Structure Audit Report**
2. **Configuration Loading & Usage Analysis**
3. **ConfigManager Integration Plan**
4. **Configuration Standards Compliance Assessment**

### Key Questions to Address

**🔍 Configuration Analysis Questions:**
1. How is the current configuration structured and organized?
2. What configuration loading mechanisms are in place?
3. How can configuration be centralized through ConfigManager?
4. What configuration parameters need dynamic management?
5. Are there any configuration security considerations?
