# update_todo_list


The update_todo_list tool enables dynamic, interactive task management within the chat interface. It replaces the entire TODO list with an updated checklist, ensuring that task status is always current and providing step-by-step tracking for complex, multi-step workflows.



## Parameters​


The tool accepts these parameters:


- todos (required): A markdown-formatted string representing the complete checklist with status indicators



## What It Does​


This tool creates and manages an interactive todo list that appears as a UI component in the chat interface. It allows for real-time task tracking, status updates, and dynamic addition of new items as they are discovered during complex workflows. The list provides a structured way to manage multi-step tasks with clear visual progress indicators.



## When is it used?​


- When managing complex, multi-step tasks that benefit from structured tracking
- When Roo needs to show progress through a series of related activities
- When tasks require step-by-step completion verification before proceeding
- When new actionable items are discovered during long or complex workflows
- When providing clear checkpoints and progress visibility to users



## Key Features​


- Full Checklist Replacement: Overwrites the existing todo list with the updated version provided
- Interactive UI Component: Displays as an editable interface element in the chat
- Multiple Status Types: Supports pending, in-progress, and completed task states
- Dynamic Task Management: Add new tasks as they arise during workflow execution
- User-Friendly Editing: Provides direct editing capabilities within the chat interface
- Step-by-Step Tracking: Enables confirmation of each step before updating and proceeding
- Progress Visualization: Clear visual indicators for task completion status
- Workflow Integration: Seamlessly integrates with task execution and completion flows



## Limitations​


- Complete Replacement: Replaces the entire list rather than making incremental updates
- Single-Level Structure: Uses single-level markdown checklists without nesting support
- Format Requirements: Requires specific markdown checkbox syntax for proper parsing
- Manual Updates: Requires explicit tool calls to update the list status
- State Management: Todo list state is tied to the current task and conversation context



## How It Works​


When the update_todo_list tool is invoked, it follows this process:


1. 
Input Validation:

Validates the required todos parameter is provided
Parses the markdown checklist format for syntax correctness
Checks for valid status indicators: [ ], [-], and [x]


2. 
List Processing:

Processes the markdown-formatted checklist
Extracts individual todo items with their status indicators
Validates the structure and format of each item


3. 
UI Integration:

Presents the updated todo list to the user for approval
Replaces any existing todo list with the new version
Renders the list as an interactive component in the chat interface


4. 
User Interaction:

Allows users to edit todos directly in the UI when in editing mode
Provides "Add Todo" functionality for real-time list expansion
Synchronizes changes back to the extension to maintain state consistency


5. 
State Management:

Updates the task's internal todo list representation
Maintains synchronization between UI state and backend data
Preserves todo list state across conversation interactions





## Checklist Format Requirements​


The tool uses a specific markdown format for todo items:


### Status Options​


- [ ] - Pending task (not started)
- [-] - In progress task (currently being worked on)
- [x] - Completed task (fully finished)


### Format Rules​


- Use single-level markdown checklist (no nesting or subtasks)
- List todos in intended execution order
- Each todo item should be clear and actionable
- Status should accurately reflect current task state



## Task Management Guidelines​


### Status Updates​


- Mark tasks as completed immediately after all work is finished
- Start the next task by marking it as in progress
- Use pending status for tasks not yet started
- Only mark tasks as completed when fully accomplished with no unresolved dependencies


### Dynamic List Management​


- Add new todos as soon as they are identified during task execution
- Remove tasks only if they are no longer relevant or explicitly requested
- Retain all unfinished tasks and update their status as needed
- If a task is blocked, keep it as in progress and add new todos for resolution steps



## Examples When Used​


- When developing a web application, Roo creates a todo list tracking design, implementation, testing, and deployment phases.
- When setting up a development environment, Roo tracks installation of dependencies, configuration steps, and verification tasks.
- When debugging complex issues, Roo maintains a list of investigation steps, potential causes, and testing procedures.
- When refactoring code, Roo tracks which files need updates, what tests need modification, and documentation changes required.
- When implementing new features, Roo manages tasks for planning, coding, testing, and integration steps.



## Usage Examples​


Creating an initial todo list for a development task:

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[ ] Analyze requirements
[ ] Design architecture  
[ ] Implement core logic
[ ] Write tests
[ ] Update documentation
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

Updating progress after completing the first task:

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Analyze requirements
[-] Design architecture
[ ] Implement core logic
[ ] Write tests
[ ] Update documentation
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

Adding new tasks discovered during implementation:

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Analyze requirements
[x] Design architecture
[x] Implement core logic
[-] Write tests
[ ] Update documentation
[ ] Add performance benchmarks
[ ] Create deployment script
</todos>
</update_todo_list>

Managing a complex debugging workflow:

<update_todo_list>
<todos>
[x] Reproduce the issue
