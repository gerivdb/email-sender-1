# Model Context Protocol (MCP)


The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standard for extending Roo Code's capabilities by connecting to external tools and services. MCP servers provide additional tools and resources that help Roo accomplish tasks beyond its built-in capabilities, such as accessing databases, custom APIs, and specialized functionality.
