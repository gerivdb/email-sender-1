Help on module compat:

NAME
    compat

DESCRIPTION
    Stuff that differs in different Python versions and platform
    distributions.

FUNCTIONS
    get_path_uid(path: str) -> int
        Return path's uid.

        Does not follow symlinks:
            https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/935#discussion_r5307003

        Placed this function in compat due to differences on AIX and
        Jython, that should eventually go away.

        :raises OSError: When path is a symlink or can't be read.

DATA
    WINDOWS = True
    __all__ = ['get_path_uid', 'stdlib_pkgs', 'WINDOWS']
    stdlib_pkgs = {'argparse', 'python', 'wsgiref'}
