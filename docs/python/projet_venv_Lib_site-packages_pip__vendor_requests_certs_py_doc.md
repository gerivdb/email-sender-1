Help on module certs:

NAME
    certs

DESCRIPTION
    requests.certs
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This module returns the preferred default CA certificate bundle. There is
    only one — the one from the certifi package.

    If you are packaging Requests, e.g., for a Linux distribution or a managed
    environment, you can change the definition of where() to return a separately
    packaged CA bundle.
