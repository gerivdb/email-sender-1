NAME
    intranges

DESCRIPTION
    Given a list of integers, made up of (hopefully) a small number of long runs
    of consecutive integers, compute a representation of the form
    ((start1, end1), (start2, end2) ...). Then answer the question "was x present
    in the original list?" in time O(log(# runs)).

FUNCTIONS
    intranges_contain(int_: int, ranges: Tuple[int, ...]) -> bool
        Determine if `int_` falls into one of the ranges in `ranges`.

    intranges_from_list(list_: List[int]) -> Tuple[int, ...]
        Represent a list of integers as a sequence of ranges:
        ((start_0, end_0), (start_1, end_1), ...), such that the original
        integers are exactly those x such that start_i <= x < end_i for some i.

        Ranges are encoded as single integers (start << 32 | end), not as tuples.

DATA
    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    Tuple = typing.Tuple
        Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

        Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

        Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
        to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
        of an int, a float and a string.

        To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].
