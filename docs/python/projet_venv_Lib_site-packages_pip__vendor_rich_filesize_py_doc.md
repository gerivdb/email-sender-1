NAME
    filesize - Functions for reporting filesizes. Borrowed from https://github.com/PyFilesystem/pyfilesystem2

DESCRIPTION
    The functions declared in this module should cover the different
    use cases needed to generate a string representation of a file size
    using several different units. Since there are many standards regarding
    file size units, three different functions have been implemented.

    See Also:
        * `Wikipedia: Binary prefix <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_prefix>`_

FUNCTIONS
    decimal(size: int, *, precision: Optional[int] = 1, separator: Optional[str] = ' ') -> str
        Convert a filesize in to a string (powers of 1000, SI prefixes).

        In this convention, ``1000 B = 1 kB``.

        This is typically the format used to advertise the storage
        capacity of USB flash drives and the like (*256 MB* meaning
        actually a storage capacity of more than *256 000 000 B*),
        or used by **Mac OS X** since v10.6 to report file sizes.

        Arguments:
            int (size): A file size.
            int (precision): The number of decimal places to include (default = 1).
            str (separator): The string to separate the value from the units (default = " ").

        Returns:
            `str`: A string containing a abbreviated file size and units.

        Example:
            >>> filesize.decimal(30000)
            '30.0 kB'
            >>> filesize.decimal(30000, precision=2, separator="")
            '30.00kB'
