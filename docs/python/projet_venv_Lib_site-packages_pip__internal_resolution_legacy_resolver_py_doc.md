NAME
    resolver - Dependency Resolution

DESCRIPTION
    The dependency resolution in pip is performed as follows:

    for top-level requirements:
        a. only one spec allowed per project, regardless of conflicts or not.
           otherwise a "double requirement" exception is raised
        b. they override sub-dependency requirements.
    for sub-dependencies
        a. "first found, wins" (where the order is breadth first)

CLASSES
    pip._internal.resolution.base.BaseResolver(builtins.object)
        Resolver

    class Resolver(pip._internal.resolution.base.BaseResolver)
     |  Resolver(preparer: pip._internal.operations.prepare.RequirementPreparer, finder: pip._internal.index.package_finder.PackageFinder, wheel_cache: Optional[pip._internal.cache.WheelCache], make_install_req: Callable[[str, Optional[pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement]], pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement], use_user_site: bool, ignore_dependencies: bool, ignore_installed: bool, ignore_requires_python: bool, force_reinstall: bool, upgrade_strategy: str, py_version_info: Optional[Tuple[int, ...]] = None) -> None
     |
     |  Resolves which packages need to be installed/uninstalled to perform     the requested operation without breaking the requirements of any package.
     |
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      Resolver
     |      pip._internal.resolution.base.BaseResolver
     |      builtins.object
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, preparer: pip._internal.operations.prepare.RequirementPreparer, finder: pip._internal.index.package_finder.PackageFinder, wheel_cache: Optional[pip._internal.cache.WheelCache], make_install_req: Callable[[str, Optional[pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement]], pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement], use_user_site: bool, ignore_dependencies: bool, ignore_installed: bool, ignore_requires_python: bool, force_reinstall: bool, upgrade_strategy: str, py_version_info: Optional[Tuple[int, ...]] = None) -> None
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |
     |  get_installation_order(self, req_set: pip._internal.req.req_set.RequirementSet) -> List[pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement]
     |      Create the installation order.
     |
     |      The installation order is topological - requirements are installed
     |      before the requiring thing. We break cycles at an arbitrary point,
     |      and make no other guarantees.
     |
     |  resolve(self, root_reqs: List[pip._internal.req.req_install.InstallRequirement], check_supported_wheels: bool) -> pip._internal.req.req_set.RequirementSet
     |      Resolve what operations need to be done
     |
     |      As a side-effect of this method, the packages (and their dependencies)
     |      are downloaded, unpacked and prepared for installation. This
     |      preparation is done by ``pip.operations.prepare``.
     |
     |      Once PyPI has static dependency metadata available, it would be
     |      possible to move the preparation to become a step separated from
     |      dependency resolution.

DATA
    DefaultDict = typing.DefaultDict
        A generic version of collections.defaultdict.

    DiscoveredDependencies = typing.DefaultDict[typing.Optional[str], typi...
    InstallRequirementProvider = typing.Callable[[str, typing.Optional[pip...
    Iterable = typing.Iterable
        A generic version of collections.abc.Iterable.

    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Set = typing.Set
        A generic version of set.

    Tuple = typing.Tuple
        Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

        Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

        Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
        to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
        of an int, a float and a string.

        To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].
