FUNCTIONS
    find_lexer_class(name)
        Return the `Lexer` subclass that with the *name* attribute as given by
        the *name* argument.

    get_lexer_by_name(_alias, **options)
        Return an instance of a `Lexer` subclass that has `alias` in its
        aliases list. The lexer is given the `options` at its
        instantiation.

        Will raise :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` if no lexer with that alias is
        found.

    get_lexer_for_filename(_fn, code=None, **options)
        Get a lexer for a filename.

        Return a `Lexer` subclass instance that has a filename pattern
        matching `fn`. The lexer is given the `options` at its
        instantiation.

        Raise :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` if no lexer for that filename
        is found.

        If multiple lexers match the filename pattern, use their ``analyse_text()``
        methods to figure out which one is more appropriate.

    guess_lexer(_text, **options)
        Return a `Lexer` subclass instance that's guessed from the text in
        `text`. For that, the :meth:`.analyse_text()` method of every known lexer
        class is called with the text as argument, and the lexer which returned the
        highest value will be instantiated and returned.

        :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` is raised if no lexer thinks it can
        handle the content.

    load_lexer_from_file(filename, lexername='CustomLexer', **options)
        Load a lexer from a file.

        This method expects a file located relative to the current working
        directory, which contains a Lexer class. By default, it expects the
        Lexer to be name CustomLexer; you can specify your own class name
        as the second argument to this function.

        Users should be very careful with the input, because this method
        is equivalent to running eval on the input file.

        Raises ClassNotFound if there are any problems importing the Lexer.
