Help on module unpacking:

NAME
    unpacking - Utilities related archives.

FUNCTIONS
    current_umask() -> int
        Get the current umask which involves having to set it temporarily.

    has_leading_dir(paths: Iterable[str]) -> bool
        Returns true if all the paths have the same leading path name
        (i.e., everything is in one subdirectory in an archive)

    is_within_directory(directory: str, target: str) -> bool
        Return true if the absolute path of target is within the directory

    set_extracted_file_to_default_mode_plus_executable(path: str) -> None
        Make file present at path have execute for user/group/world
        (chmod +x) is no-op on windows per python docs

    split_leading_dir(path: str) -> List[str]

    unpack_file(filename: str, location: str, content_type: Optional[str] = None) -> None

    untar_file(filename: str, location: str) -> None
        Untar the file (with path `filename`) to the destination `location`.
        All files are written based on system defaults and umask (i.e. permissions
        are not preserved), except that regular file members with any execute
        permissions (user, group, or world) have "chmod +x" applied on top of the
        default.  Note that for windows, any execute changes using os.chmod are
        no-ops per the python docs.

    unzip_file(filename: str, location: str, flatten: bool = True) -> None
        Unzip the file (with path `filename`) to the destination `location`.  All
        files are written based on system defaults and umask (i.e. permissions are
        not preserved), except that regular file members with any execute
        permissions (user, group, or world) have "chmod +x" applied after being
        written. Note that for windows, any execute changes using os.chmod are
        no-ops per the python docs.

    zip_item_is_executable(info: zipfile.ZipInfo) -> bool

DATA
    BZ2_EXTENSIONS = ('.tar.bz2', '.tbz')
    Iterable = typing.Iterable
        A generic version of collections.abc.Iterable.

    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    SUPPORTED_EXTENSIONS = ('.zip', '.whl', '.tar.gz', '.tgz', '.tar', '.t...

    XZ_EXTENSIONS = ('.tar.xz', '.txz', '.tlz', '.tar.lz', '.tar.lzma')
    ZIP_EXTENSIONS = ('.zip', '.whl')
