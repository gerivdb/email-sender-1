NAME
    _log - Customize logging

DESCRIPTION
    Defines custom logger class for the `logger.verbose(...)` method.

    init_logging() must be called before any other modules that call logging.getLogger.

CLASSES
    logging.Logger(logging.Filterer)
        VerboseLogger

    class VerboseLogger(logging.Logger)
     |  VerboseLogger(name, level=0)
     |
     |  Custom Logger, defining a verbose log-level
     |
     |  VERBOSE is between INFO and DEBUG.
     |
     |  Method resolution order:
     |      VerboseLogger
     |      logging.Logger
     |      logging.Filterer
     |      builtins.object
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  verbose(self, msg: str, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> None

     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Methods inherited from logging.Logger:
     |
     |  __init__(self, name, level=0)
     |      Initialize the logger with a name and an optional level.
     |
     |  __reduce__(self)
     |      Helper for pickle.
     |
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |
     |  addHandler(self, hdlr)
     |      Add the specified handler to this logger.
     |
     |  callHandlers(self, record)
     |      Pass a record to all relevant handlers.
     |
     |      Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
     |      logger hierarchy. If no handler was found, output a one-off error
     |      message to sys.stderr. Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a
     |      logger with the "propagate" attribute set to zero is found - that
     |      will be the last logger whose handlers are called.
     |
     |  critical(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'CRITICAL'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.critical("Houston, we have a %s", "major disaster", exc_info=True)
     |
     |  debug(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'DEBUG'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.debug("Houston, we have a %s", "thorny problem", exc_info=True)
     |
     |  error(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'ERROR'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.error("Houston, we have a %s", "major problem", exc_info=True)
     |
     |  exception(self, msg, *args, exc_info=True, **kwargs)
     |      Convenience method for logging an ERROR with exception information.
     |
     |  fatal(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Don't use this method, use critical() instead.
     |
     |  findCaller(self, stack_info=False, stacklevel=1)
     |      Find the stack frame of the caller so that we can note the source
     |      file name, line number and function name.
     |
     |  getChild(self, suffix)
     |      Get a logger which is a descendant to this one.
     |
     |      This is a convenience method, such that
     |
     |      logging.getLogger('abc').getChild('def.ghi')
     |
     |      is the same as
     |
     |      logging.getLogger('abc.def.ghi')
     |
     |      It's useful, for example, when the parent logger is named using
     |      __name__ rather than a literal string.
     |
     |  getChildren(self)
     |
     |  getEffectiveLevel(self)
     |      Get the effective level for this logger.
     |
     |      Loop through this logger and its parents in the logger hierarchy,
     |      looking for a non-zero logging level. Return the first one found.
     |
     |  handle(self, record)
     |      Call the handlers for the specified record.
     |
     |      This method is used for unpickled records received from a socket, as
     |      well as those created locally. Logger-level filtering is applied.
     |
     |  hasHandlers(self)
     |      See if this logger has any handlers configured.
     |
     |      Loop through all handlers for this logger and its parents in the
     |      logger hierarchy. Return True if a handler was found, else False.
     |      Stop searching up the hierarchy whenever a logger with the "propagate"
     |      attribute set to zero is found - that will be the last logger which
     |      is checked for the existence of handlers.
     |
     |  info(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'INFO'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.info("Houston, we have a %s", "notable problem", exc_info=True)
     |
     |  isEnabledFor(self, level)
     |      Is this logger enabled for level 'level'?
     |
     |  log(self, level, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with the integer severity 'level'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.log(level, "We have a %s", "mysterious problem", exc_info=True)
     |
     |  makeRecord(self, name, level, fn, lno, msg, args, exc_info, func=None, extra=None, sinfo=None)
     |      A factory method which can be overridden in subclasses to create
     |      specialized LogRecords.
     |
     |  removeHandler(self, hdlr)
     |      Remove the specified handler from this logger.
     |
     |  setLevel(self, level)
     |      Set the logging level of this logger.  level must be an int or a str.
     |
     |  warn(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |
     |  warning(self, msg, *args, **kwargs)
     |      Log 'msg % args' with severity 'WARNING'.
     |
     |      To pass exception information, use the keyword argument exc_info with
     |      a true value, e.g.
     |
     |      logger.warning("Houston, we have a %s", "bit of a problem", exc_info=True)

     |  Methods inherited from logging.Filterer:
     |
     |  addFilter(self, filter)
     |      Add the specified filter to this handler.
     |
     |  filter(self, record)
     |      Determine if a record is loggable by consulting all the filters.
     |
     |      The default is to allow the record to be logged; any filter can veto
     |      this by returning a false value.
     |      If a filter attached to a handler returns a log record instance,
     |      then that instance is used in place of the original log record in
     |      any further processing of the event by that handler.
     |      If a filter returns any other true value, the original log record
     |      is used in any further processing of the event by that handler.
     |
     |      If none of the filters return false values, this method returns
     |      a log record.
     |      If any of the filters return a false value, this method returns
     |      a false value.
     |
     |      .. versionchanged:: 3.2
     |
     |         Allow filters to be just callables.
     |
     |      .. versionchanged:: 3.12
     |         Allow filters to return a LogRecord instead of
     |         modifying it in place.
     |
     |  removeFilter(self, filter)
     |      Remove the specified filter from this handler.
