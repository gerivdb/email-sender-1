Help on module egg_link:

NAME
    egg_link

FUNCTIONS
    egg_link_path_from_location(raw_name: str) -> Optional[str]
        Return the path for the .egg-link file if it exists, otherwise, None.

        There's 3 scenarios:
        1) not in a virtualenv
           try to find in site.USER_SITE, then site_packages
        2) in a no-global virtualenv
           try to find in site_packages
        3) in a yes-global virtualenv
           try to find in site_packages, then site.USER_SITE
           (don't look in global location)

        For #1 and #3, there could be odd cases, where there's an egg-link in 2
        locations.

        This method will just return the first one found.

    egg_link_path_from_sys_path(raw_name: str) -> Optional[str]
        Look for a .egg-link file for project name, by walking sys.path.
