NAME
    scanner

DESCRIPTION
    pygments.scanner
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    This library implements a regex based scanner. Some languages
    like Pascal are easy to parse but have some keywords that
    depend on the context. Because of this it's impossible to lex
    that just by using a regular expression lexer like the
    `RegexLexer`.

    Have a look at the `DelphiLexer` to get an idea of how to use
    this scanner.

    class Scanner(builtins.object)
     |  Scanner(text, flags=0)
     |
     |  Simple scanner
     |
     |  All method patterns are regular expression strings (not
     |  compiled expressions!)
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, text, flags=0)
     |      :param text:    The text which should be scanned
     |      :param flags:   default regular expression flags
     |
     |  __repr__(self)
     |      Return repr(self).
     |
     |  check(self, pattern)
     |      Apply `pattern` on the current position and return
     |      the match object. (Doesn't touch pos). Use this for
     |      lookahead.
     |
     |  get_char(self)
     |      Scan exactly one char.
     |
     |  scan(self, pattern)
     |      Scan the text for the given pattern and update pos/match
     |      and related fields. The return value is a boolean that
     |      indicates if the pattern matched. The matched value is
     |      stored on the instance as ``match``, the last value is
     |      stored as ``last``. ``start_pos`` is the position of the
     |      pointer before the pattern was matched, ``pos`` is the
     |      end position.
     |
     |  test(self, pattern)
     |      Apply a pattern on the current position and check
     |      if it patches. Doesn't touch pos.
     |
     |  ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables
     |
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object
     |
     |  eos
     |      `True` if the scanner reached the end of text.
