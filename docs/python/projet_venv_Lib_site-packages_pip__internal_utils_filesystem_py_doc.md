NAME
    filesystem

FUNCTIONS
    adjacent_tmp_file(path: str, **kwargs: Any) -> Generator[BinaryIO, NoneType, NoneType]
        Return a file-like object pointing to a tmp file next to path.

        The file is created securely and is ensured to be written to disk
        after the context reaches its end.

        kwargs will be passed to tempfile.NamedTemporaryFile to control
        the way the temporary file will be opened.

    check_path_owner(path: str) -> bool

    directory_size(path: str) -> Union[int, float]

    file_size(path: str) -> Union[int, float]

    find_files(path: str, pattern: str) -> List[str]
        Returns a list of absolute paths of files beneath path, recursively,
        with filenames which match the UNIX-style shell glob pattern.

    format_directory_size(path: str) -> str

    format_file_size(path: str) -> str

    test_writable_dir(path: str) -> bool
        Check if a directory is writable.

        Uses os.access() on POSIX, tries creating files on Windows.

DATA
    Generator = typing.Generator
        A generic version of collections.abc.Generator.

    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    Union = typing.Union
        Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

        On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
        can also be used to denote unions;
        X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

        To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
        - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
        - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
          type(None).
        - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

            assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

        - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

            assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

        - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

        - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

        - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
        - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
