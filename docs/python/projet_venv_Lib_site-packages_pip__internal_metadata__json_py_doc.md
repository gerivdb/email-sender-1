    Union = typing.Union
        Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

        On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
        can also be used to denote unions;
        X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

        To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
        - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
        - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
          type(None).
        - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

            assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

        - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

            assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

        - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

        - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

        - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
        - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
