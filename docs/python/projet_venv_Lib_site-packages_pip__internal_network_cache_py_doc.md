Help on module cache:

NAME
    cache - HTTP cache implementation.

CLASSES
    pip._vendor.cachecontrol.cache.SeparateBodyBaseCache(pip._vendor.cachecontrol.cache.BaseCache)
        SafeFileCache

    class SafeFileCache(pip._vendor.cachecontrol.cache.SeparateBodyBaseCache)
     |  SafeFileCache(directory: str) -> None
     |
     |  A file based cache which is safe to use even when the target directory may
     |  not be accessible or writable.
     |
     |  There is a race condition when two processes try to write and/or read the
     |  same entry at the same time, since each entry consists of two separate
     |  files (https://github.com/psf/cachecontrol/issues/324).  We therefore have
     |  additional logic that makes sure that both files to be present before
     |  returning an entry; this fixes the read side of the race condition.
     |
     |  For the write side, we assume that the server will only ever return the
     |  same data for the same URL, which ought to be the case for files pip is
     |  downloading.  PyPI does not have a mechanism to swap out a wheel for
     |  another wheel, for example.  If this assumption is not true, the
     |  CacheControl issue will need to be fixed.

FUNCTIONS
    is_from_cache(response: pip._vendor.requests.models.Response) -> bool

    suppressed_cache_errors() -> Generator[NoneType, NoneType, NoneType]
        If we can't access the cache then we can just skip caching and process
        requests as if caching wasn't enabled.

DATA
    Generator = typing.Generator
        A generic version of collections.abc.Generator.

    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Union = typing.Union
        Union type; Union[X, Y] means either X or Y.

        On Python 3.10 and higher, the | operator
        can also be used to denote unions;
        X | Y means the same thing to the type checker as Union[X, Y].

        To define a union, use e.g. Union[int, str]. Details:
        - The arguments must be types and there must be at least one.
        - None as an argument is a special case and is replaced by
          type(None).
        - Unions of unions are flattened, e.g.::

            assert Union[Union[int, str], float] == Union[int, str, float]

        - Unions of a single argument vanish, e.g.::

            assert Union[int] == int  # The constructor actually returns int

        - Redundant arguments are skipped, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str, int] == Union[int, str]

        - When comparing unions, the argument order is ignored, e.g.::

            assert Union[int, str] == Union[str, int]

        - You cannot subclass or instantiate a union.
        - You can use Optional[X] as a shorthand for Union[X, None].
