problem in src\langchain\examples\agents_example.py - PydanticUserError: A non-annotated attribute was detected: `URL = 'https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions'`. All model fields require a type annotation; if `URL` is not meant to be a field, you may be able to resolve this error by annotating it as a `ClassVar` or updating `model_config['ignored_types']`.
