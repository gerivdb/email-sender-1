DESCRIPTION
    Pygments
    ~~~~~~~~

    Pygments is a syntax highlighting package written in Python.

    It is a generic syntax highlighter for general use in all kinds of software
    such as forum systems, wikis or other applications that need to prettify
    source code. Highlights are:

    * a wide range of common languages and markup formats is supported
    * special attention is paid to details, increasing quality by a fair amount
    * support for new languages and formats are added easily
    * a number of output formats, presently HTML, LaTeX, RTF, SVG, all image
      formats that PIL supports, and ANSI sequences
    * it is usable as a command-line tool and as a library
    * ... and it highlights even Brainfuck!

    The `Pygments master branch`_ is installable with ``easy_install Pygments==dev``.

FUNCTIONS
    format(tokens, formatter, outfile=None)
        Format ``tokens`` (an iterable of tokens) with the formatter ``formatter``
        (a `Formatter` instance).

        If ``outfile`` is given and a valid file object (an object with a
        ``write`` method), the result will be written to it, otherwise it
        is returned as a string.

    highlight(code, lexer, formatter, outfile=None)
        This is the most high-level highlighting function. It combines `lex` and
        `format` in one function.

    lex(code, lexer)
        Lex `code` with the `lexer` (must be a `Lexer` instance)
        and return an iterable of tokens. Currently, this only calls
        `lexer.get_tokens()`.

DATA
    __all__ = ['lex', 'format', 'highlight']
    __docformat__ = 'restructuredtext'
