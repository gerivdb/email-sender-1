NAME
    retry

FUNCTIONS
    perf_counter(...)
        perf_counter() -> float

        Performance counter for benchmarking.

    retry(wait: float, stop_after_delay: float) -> Callable[[Callable[~P, ~T]], Callable[~P, ~T]]
        Decorator to automatically retry a function on error.

        If the function raises, the function is recalled with the same arguments
        until it returns or the time limit is reached. When the time limit is
        surpassed, the last exception raised is reraised.

        :param wait: The time to wait after an error before retrying, in seconds.
        :param stop_after_delay: The time limit after which retries will cease,
            in seconds.

    sleep(...)
        sleep(seconds)

        Delay execution for a given number of seconds.  The argument may be
        a floating-point number for subsecond precision.

DATA
    Callable = typing.Callable
        Deprecated alias to collections.abc.Callable.

        Callable[[int], str] signifies a function that takes a single
        parameter of type int and returns a str.

        The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
        values: the argument list and the return type.
        The argument list must be a list of types, a ParamSpec,
        Concatenate or ellipsis. The return type must be a single type.

        There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
        such function types are rarely used as callback types.

    P = ~P
    T = ~T
