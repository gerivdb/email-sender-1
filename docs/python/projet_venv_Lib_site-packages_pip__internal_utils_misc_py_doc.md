     |      :param source_dir: The source directory to invoke the build backend for
     |      :param build_backend: The build backend spec
     |      :param backend_path: Additional path entries for the build backend spec
     |      :param runner: The :ref:`subprocess runner <Subprocess Runners>` to use

     |  build_editable(self, wheel_directory: str, config_settings: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]] = None, metadata_directory: Optional[str] = None) -> str
     |      Build an editable wheel from this project.

     |
     |          If the ``build_editable`` hook was called in the fallback for
     |          :meth:`prepare_metadata_for_build_editable`, the build backend
     |          would not be invoked. Instead, the previously built wheel will be
     |          copied to ``wheel_directory`` and the name of that file will be
     |          returned.
     |
     |  build_sdist(self, sdist_directory: str, config_settings: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]] = None) -> str
     |      Build an sdist from this project.
     |
     |      :returns:
     |          The name of the newly created sdist within ``wheel_directory``.
     |
     |  build_wheel(self, wheel_directory: str, config_settings: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]] = None, metadata_directory: Optional[str] = None) -> str
     |      Build a wheel from this project.

     |
     |      .. admonition:: Interaction with fallback
     |
     |          If the ``build_wheel`` hook was called in the fallback for
     |          :meth:`prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel`, the build backend would
     |          not be invoked. Instead, the previously built wheel will be copied
     |          to ``wheel_directory`` and the name of that file will be returned.

     |
     |  get_requires_for_build_wheel(self, config_settings: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]] = None) -> List[str]
     |      Get additional dependencies required for building a wheel.
     |
     |      :returns: A list of :pep:`dependency specifiers <508>`.
     |      :rtype: list[str]

     |      Prepare a ``*.dist-info`` folder with metadata for this project.
     |
     |      :returns: Name of the newly created subfolder within
     |                ``metadata_directory``, containing the metadata.
     |      :rtype: str
     |
     |      .. admonition:: Fallback
     |
     |          If the build backend does not define a hook with this name and
     |          ``_allow_fallback`` is truthy, the backend will be asked to build a
     |          wheel via the ``build_editable`` hook and the dist-info
     |          extracted from that will be returned.
     |
     |  prepare_metadata_for_build_wheel(self, metadata_directory: str, config_settings: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, List[str]]]] = None, _allow_fallback: bool = True) -> str
     |      Prepare a ``*.dist-info`` folder with metadata for this project.

FUNCTIONS
    ask(message: str, options: Iterable[str]) -> str
        Ask the message interactively, with the given possible responses

    backup_dir(dir: str, ext: str = '.bak') -> str
        Figure out the name of a directory to back up the given dir to
        (adding .bak, .bak2, etc)

    check_externally_managed() -> None
        Check whether the current environment is externally managed.

        If the ``EXTERNALLY-MANAGED`` config file is found, the current environment
        is considered externally managed, and an ExternallyManagedEnvironment is
        raised.

    display_path(path: str) -> str
        Gives the display value for a given path, making it relative to cwd
        if possible.

    ensure_dir(path: str) -> None
        os.path.makedirs without EEXIST.

    format_size(bytes: float) -> str

    get_prog() -> str

    is_installable_dir(path: str) -> bool
        Is path is a directory containing pyproject.toml or setup.py?

        If pyproject.toml exists, this is a PEP 517 project. Otherwise we look for
        a legacy setuptools layout by identifying setup.py. We don't check for the
        setup.cfg because using it without setup.py is only available for PEP 517
        projects, which are already covered by the pyproject.toml check.

    normalize_path(path: str, resolve_symlinks: bool = True) -> str
        Convert a path to its canonical, case-normalized, absolute version.

    remove_auth_from_url(url: str) -> str
        Return a copy of url with 'username:password@' removed.

    renames(old: str, new: str) -> None
        Like os.renames(), but handles renaming across devices.

    rmtree(dir: str, ignore_errors: bool = False, onexc: Optional[Callable[[function, pathlib.Path, BaseException], Any]] = None) -> None

    splitext(path: str) -> Tuple[str, str]
        Like os.path.splitext, but take off .tar too

    __all__ = ['rmtree', 'display_path', 'backup_dir', 'ask', 'splitext', ...
