Help on module configuration:

NAME
    configuration - Configuration management setup

DESCRIPTION
    Some terminology:
    - name
      As written in config files.
    - value
      Value associated with a name
    - key
      Name combined with it's section (section.name)
    - variant
      A single word describing where the configuration key-value pair came from

CLASSES
    builtins.object
        Configuration

    class Configuration(builtins.object)
     |  Configuration(isolated: bool, load_only: Optional[configuration.Kind] = None) -> None
     |
     |  Handles management of configuration.
     |
     |  Provides an interface to accessing and managing configuration files.
     |
     |  This class converts provides an API that takes "section.key-name" style
     |  keys and stores the value associated with it as "key-name" under the
     |  section "section".
     |
     |  This allows for a clean interface wherein the both the section and the
     |  key-name are preserved in an easy to manage form in the configuration files
     |  and the data stored is also nice.
     |
     |  Methods defined here:
     |
     |  __init__(self, isolated: bool, load_only: Optional[configuration.Kind] = None) -> None
     |      Initialize self.  See help(type(self)) for accurate signature.
     |
     |  __repr__(self) -> str
     |      Return repr(self).
     |
     |  get_environ_vars(self) -> Iterable[Tuple[str, str]]
     |      Returns a generator with all environmental vars with prefix PIP_
     |
     |  get_file_to_edit(self) -> Optional[str]
     |      Returns the file with highest priority in configuration
     |
     |  get_value(self, key: str) -> Any
     |      Get a value from the configuration.
     |
     |  get_values_in_config(self, variant: configuration.Kind) -> Dict[str, Any]
     |      Get values present in a config file
     |
     |  items(self) -> Iterable[Tuple[str, Any]]
     |      Returns key-value pairs like dict.items() representing the loaded
     |      configuration
     |
     |  iter_config_files(self) -> Iterable[Tuple[configuration.Kind, List[str]]]
     |      Yields variant and configuration files associated with it.
     |
     |      This should be treated like items of a dictionary. The order
     |      here doesn't affect what gets overridden. That is controlled
     |      by OVERRIDE_ORDER. However this does control the order they are
     |      displayed to the user. It's probably most ergononmic to display
     |      things in the same order as OVERRIDE_ORDER
     |
     |  load(self) -> None
     |      Loads configuration from configuration files and environment
     |
     |  save(self) -> None
     |      Save the current in-memory state.
     |
     |  set_value(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None
     |      Modify a value in the configuration.
     |
     |  unset_value(self, key: str) -> None
     |      Unset a value in the configuration.
     |

     |  Data descriptors defined here:
     |
     |  __dict__
     |      dictionary for instance variables
     |
     |  __weakref__
     |      list of weak references to the object

FUNCTIONS
    get_configuration_files() -> Dict[configuration.Kind, List[str]]

DATA
    CONFIG_BASENAME = 'pip.ini'
    Dict = typing.Dict
        A generic version of dict.

    ENV_NAMES_IGNORED = ('version', 'help')
    Iterable = typing.Iterable
        A generic version of collections.abc.Iterable.

    Kind = configuration.Kind
    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    OVERRIDE_ORDER = ('global', 'user', 'site', 'env', 'env-var')
    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Tuple = typing.Tuple
        Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

        Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

        Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
        to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
        of an int, a float and a string.

        To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].

    VALID_LOAD_ONLY = ('user', 'global', 'site')
    WINDOWS = True
    logger = <VerboseLogger configuration (WARNING)>
