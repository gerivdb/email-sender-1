     |
     |  rollback(self) -> None

     |
     |  stash(self, path: str) -> str

FUNCTIONS
    compact(paths: Iterable[str]) -> Set[str]
        Compact a path set to contain the minimal number of paths
        necessary to contain all paths in the set. If /a/path/ and
        /a/path/to/a/file.txt are both in the set, leave only the
        shorter path.

    compress_for_output_listing(paths: Iterable[str]) -> Tuple[Set[str], Set[str]]
        Returns a tuple of 2 sets of which paths to display to user

        The first set contains paths that would be deleted. Files of a package
        are not added and the top-level directory of the package has a '*' added
        at the end - to signify that all it's contents are removed.

        The second set contains files that would have been skipped in the above
        folders.

    compress_for_rename(paths: Iterable[str]) -> Set[str]
        Returns a set containing the paths that need to be renamed.

        This set may include directories when the original sequence of paths
        included every file on disk.

    uninstallation_paths(dist: pip._internal.metadata.base.BaseDistribution) -> Generator[str, NoneType, NoneType]
        Yield all the uninstallation paths for dist based on RECORD-without-.py[co]

        Yield paths to all the files in RECORD. For each .py file in RECORD, add
        the .pyc and .pyo in the same directory.

        UninstallPathSet.add() takes care of the __pycache__ .py[co].

        If RECORD is not found, raises an error,
        with possible information from the INSTALLER file.

DATA
    Callable = typing.Callable
        Deprecated alias to collections.abc.Callable.

        Callable[[int], str] signifies a function that takes a single
        parameter of type int and returns a str.

        The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
        values: the argument list and the return type.
        The argument list must be a list of types, a ParamSpec,
        Concatenate or ellipsis. The return type must be a single type.

        There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
        such function types are rarely used as callback types.

    Dict = typing.Dict
        A generic version of dict.

    Generator = typing.Generator
        A generic version of collections.abc.Generator.

    Iterable = typing.Iterable
        A generic version of collections.abc.Iterable.

    List = typing.List
        A generic version of list.

    Optional = typing.Optional
        Optional[X] is equivalent to Union[X, None].

    Set = typing.Set
        A generic version of set.

    Tuple = typing.Tuple
        Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

        Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

        Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
        to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
        of an int, a float and a string.

        To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].
