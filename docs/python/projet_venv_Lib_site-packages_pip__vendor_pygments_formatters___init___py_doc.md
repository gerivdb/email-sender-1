DESCRIPTION
    pygments.formatters
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    Pygments formatters.

FUNCTIONS
    get_all_formatters()
        Return a generator for all formatter classes.

    get_formatter_by_name(_alias, **options)
        Return an instance of a :class:`.Formatter` subclass that has `alias` in its
        aliases list. The formatter is given the `options` at its instantiation.

        Will raise :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` if no formatter with that
        alias is found.

    get_formatter_for_filename(fn, **options)
        Return a :class:`.Formatter` subclass instance that has a filename pattern
        matching `fn`. The formatter is given the `options` at its instantiation.

        Will raise :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` if no formatter for that filename
        is found.

    load_formatter_from_file(filename, formattername='CustomFormatter', **options)
        Return a `Formatter` subclass instance loaded from the provided file, relative
        to the current directory.

        The file is expected to contain a Formatter class named ``formattername``
        (by default, CustomFormatter). Users should be very careful with the input, because
        this method is equivalent to running ``eval()`` on the input file. The formatter is
        given the `options` at its instantiation.

        :exc:`pygments.util.ClassNotFound` is raised if there are any errors loading
        the formatter.
