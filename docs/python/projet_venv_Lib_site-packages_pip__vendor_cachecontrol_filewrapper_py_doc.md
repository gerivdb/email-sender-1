CLASSES
    builtins.object
        CallbackFileWrapper

    class CallbackFileWrapper(builtins.object)
     |  CallbackFileWrapper(fp: 'HTTPResponse', callback: 'Callable[[bytes], None] | None') -> 'None'
     |
     |  Small wrapper around a fp object which will tee everything read into a
     |  buffer, and when that file is closed it will execute a callback with the
     |  contents of that buffer.
     |
     |  All attributes are proxied to the underlying file object.
     |
     |  This class uses members with a double underscore (__) leading prefix so as
     |  not to accidentally shadow an attribute.
     |
     |  The data is stored in a temporary file until it is all available.  As long
     |  as the temporary files directory is disk-based (sometimes it's a
     |  memory-backed-``tmpfs`` on Linux), data will be unloaded to disk if memory
     |  pressure is high.  For small files the disk usually won't be used at all,
     |  it'll all be in the filesystem memory cache, so there should be no
     |  performance impact.

DATA
    Callable = typing.Callable
        Deprecated alias to collections.abc.Callable.

        Callable[[int], str] signifies a function that takes a single
        parameter of type int and returns a str.

        The subscription syntax must always be used with exactly two
        values: the argument list and the return type.
        The argument list must be a list of types, a ParamSpec,
        Concatenate or ellipsis. The return type must be a single type.

        There is no syntax to indicate optional or keyword arguments;
        such function types are rarely used as callback types.

    TYPE_CHECKING = False
