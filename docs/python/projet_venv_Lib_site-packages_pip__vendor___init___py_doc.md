Help on module __init__:

NAME
    __init__

DESCRIPTION
    pip._vendor is for vendoring dependencies of pip to prevent needing pip to
    depend on something external.

    Files inside of pip._vendor should be considered immutable and should only be
    updated to versions from upstream.

FUNCTIONS
    vendored(modulename)
        # Define a small helper function to alias our vendored modules to the real ones
        # if the vendored ones do not exist. This idea of this was taken from
        # https://github.com/kennethreitz/requests/pull/2567.
