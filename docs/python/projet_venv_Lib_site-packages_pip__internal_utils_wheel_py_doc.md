NAME
    wheel - Support functions for working with wheel files.

FUNCTIONS
    check_compatibility(version: Tuple[int, ...], name: str) -> None
        Raises errors or warns if called with an incompatible Wheel-Version.

        pip should refuse to install a Wheel-Version that's a major series
        ahead of what it's compatible with (e.g 2.0 > 1.1); and warn when
        installing a version only minor version ahead (e.g 1.2 > 1.1).

        version: a 2-tuple representing a Wheel-Version (Major, Minor)
        name: name of wheel or package to raise exception about

        :raises UnsupportedWheel: when an incompatible Wheel-Version is given

    parse_wheel(wheel_zip: zipfile.ZipFile, name: str) -> Tuple[str, email.message.Message]
        Extract information from the provided wheel, ensuring it meets basic
        standards.

        Returns the name of the .dist-info directory and the parsed WHEEL metadata.

    read_wheel_metadata_file(source: zipfile.ZipFile, path: str) -> bytes

    wheel_dist_info_dir(source: zipfile.ZipFile, name: str) -> str
        Returns the name of the contained .dist-info directory.

        Raises AssertionError or UnsupportedWheel if not found, >1 found, or
        it doesn't match the provided name.

    wheel_metadata(source: zipfile.ZipFile, dist_info_dir: str) -> email.message.Message
        Return the WHEEL metadata of an extracted wheel, if possible.
        Otherwise, raise UnsupportedWheel.

    wheel_version(wheel_data: email.message.Message) -> Tuple[int, ...]
        Given WHEEL metadata, return the parsed Wheel-Version.
        Otherwise, raise UnsupportedWheel.

DATA
    Tuple = typing.Tuple
        Deprecated alias to builtins.tuple.

        Tuple[X, Y] is the cross-product type of X and Y.

        Example: Tuple[T1, T2] is a tuple of two elements corresponding
        to type variables T1 and T2.  Tuple[int, float, str] is a tuple
        of an int, a float and a string.

        To specify a variable-length tuple of homogeneous type, use Tuple[T, ...].
