## 🔧 **1. GitHub Secrets Configuration**

To enable notifications and full functionality, configure these GitHub repository secrets:

### **Required Secrets:**
```bash
# Slack Integration
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL="https://hooks.slack.com/services/YOUR/WEBHOOK/URL"

# Email Integration  
EMAIL_USER="your-smtp-username"
EMAIL_PASSWORD="your-smtp-password"

# Optional: Custom API Keys
NOTION_API_KEY="your-notion-api-key"  # If using Notion integration
```

### **How to Add Secrets:**
1. Go to your GitHub repository
2. Navigate to `Settings` → `Secrets and variables` → `Actions`
3. Click `New repository secret`
4. Add each secret from the list above

## 👥 **2. Team Training & PR Commands**

### **📚 Review Team Quick Reference**

The system uses PR comments to control the review workflow:

#### **🔧 Available Commands:**
```bash
# Approve and merge contribution
/jules approve

# Decline with feedback
/jules decline "Reason for decline"

# Request changes before approval
/jules request-changes "What needs to be changed"

# Re-run quality assessment
/jules reassess

# Override quality gates (admin only)
/jules override "Emergency deployment reason"

# Get system status
/jules status
```

#### **📊 Quality Score Interpretation:**
- **80-100:** 🟢 **Fast Track** - Minimal review, auto-approved
- **60-79:** 🟡 **Standard Review** - Normal review process
- **0-59:** 🔴 **Enhanced Review** - Thorough review required

#### **🎯 Review Process:**
1. **Quality Assessment Runs Automatically** when PR is opened
2. **Review Type Assigned** based on quality score
3. **Notifications Sent** to appropriate channels
4. **Human Reviewer** uses commands to control workflow
5. **Integration Happens** automatically after approval

---

## 🔔 **3. Notification Channels Setup**

### **Slack Channels (Recommended):**
```bash
#jules-bot-reviews     # Main review notifications
#code-quality         # Quality assessment reports  
#dev-alerts          # System status and errors
```

### **Email Lists:**
- **Admins:** System administrators and leads
- **Reviewers:** Code reviewers and senior developers
- **Team:** All team members for general notifications

### **Notification Rules:**
- ✅ **All quality assessments** get logged

## 📊 **4. Performance Monitoring**

### **Built-in Metrics Dashboard:**
The system automatically collects:
- ⏱️ **Review cycle times**
- 📈 **Quality score trends**
- 🎯 **Approval/decline rates**
- 🚨 **Error frequencies**
- 👥 **Reviewer performance**

### **Accessing Metrics:**
```bash
# View current metrics
python .github/scripts/metrics_collector.py --report

# Generate weekly summary
python .github/scripts/metrics_collector.py --weekly-summary

# Export data for analysis
python .github/scripts/metrics_collector.py --export-csv
```

---

## 🎯 **5. Quality Threshold Tuning**

### **Initial Recommended Settings (Already Configured):**
```yaml
quality_thresholds:
  fast_track: 80    # High quality, minimal review
  standard: 60      # Good quality, standard review  
  enhanced: 0       # Lower quality, enhanced review

quality_weights:
  file_count: 0.15      # 15% - Number of files
  file_size: 0.10       # 10% - Large file detection
  security: 0.25        # 25% - Security scanning
  commit_quality: 0.20  # 20% - Commit messages
  configuration: 0.15   # 15% - Config file safety
  documentation: 0.15   # 15% - Documentation
```

### **🔧 Tuning Process:**
1. **Monitor** initial performance for 2 weeks
2. **Analyze** metrics to identify patterns
3. **Adjust** thresholds based on team velocity
4. **Test** changes with dry-run mode
5. **Deploy** optimized configuration

---

## 🚨 **6. Emergency Procedures**

### **🆘 Emergency Override:**
If the system blocks a critical deployment:
```bash
# Admin override command
/jules override "Emergency deployment - [ticket-number]"

# Or disable temporarily
# Edit .github/jules-config.yml
# Set quality_thresholds.fast_track: 0
```

### **🔧 System Maintenance:**
```bash
# Disable system temporarily
# Comment out workflow triggers in:
# .github/workflows/jules-review-approval.yml

# Re-enable by uncommitting the changes
```
